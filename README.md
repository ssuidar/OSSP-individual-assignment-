## Introduction

Puppy Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution that is easy to use and can run on older hardware. This project explores its installation and the implementation of the `chmod()` system call, which is crucial for managing file permissions in Unix-like operating systems.

## Installation of Puppy Linux

### Step 1: Downloading Puppy Linux

To get started, download the latest version of Puppy Linux from the official website. You can find various versions tailored for different needs. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to downloading and creating a bootable USB drive:

1. Visit the [Puppy Linux website](http://puppylinux.com).
2. Choose a version that suits your needs.
3. Download the ISO file.
4. Use a tool like Rufus or UNetbootin to create a bootable USB drive.

### Step 2: Booting from USB

Once you have created a bootable USB drive, follow these steps:

1. Insert the USB drive into your computer.
2. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings.
3. Change the boot order to prioritize USB drives.
4. Save changes and exit.

### Step 3: Installing Puppy Linux

Follow the on-screen instructions to install Puppy Linux. The process is straightforward and user-friendly. You will have options for a full installation or a frugal installation, depending on your needs.

### Step 4: Initial Setup

After installation, configure your system settings, including:

- Language
- Time zone
- Network settings

### Step 5: Familiarizing with the Interface

Puppy Linux offers a simple and intuitive interface. Spend some time exploring the desktop environment and available applications.

## Understanding `chmod()` System Call

The `chmod()` system call is essential for managing file permissions. It allows users to change the read, write, and execute permissions of files and directories.

### Syntax

```c
int chmod(const char *path, mode_t mode);
```

### Parameters

- `path`: The file or directory path.
- `mode`: The new permissions to set.

### Permission Types

Permissions are represented using a combination of bits:

- Read (r): 4
- Write (w): 2
- Execute (x): 1

You can combine these values to set specific permissions. For example:

- `chmod 755 filename`: Grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read and execute permissions to others.

### Example Code

Here is a simple example of how to use `chmod()` in a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main() {
    const char *file_path = "example.txt";
    mode_t new_permissions = 0755; // Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x

    if (chmod(file_path, new_permissions) == -1) {
        perror("chmod failed");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Permissions changed successfully.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Compiling and Running the Code

1. Save the code in a file named `change_permissions.c`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Compile the code using:

   ```bash
   gcc change_permissions.c -o change_permissions
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./change_permissions
   ```
